        <h1>Welcome to Media Buster</h1>
        <h2>A community built for seekers, rememberers, and digital archaeologists.</h2>

        Have you ever had a memory of a show, a game, or a strange commercial—but no one else remembers it? Maybe it aired once at 2AM, vanished from the internet, or was buried under licensing and time. That’s where we come in.

        Media Buster is a forum dedicated to the hunt for lost media—from forgotten TV pilots and unreleased video games to obscure web animations and vanishing internet lore. Whether you’re chasing something that aired in your childhood or helping someone else put the pieces together, this is your space.

        We believe every piece of media has a story—how it was made, how it disappeared, and how it might still be found.

        Our community:<br>

        Shares memories, clues, and theories,<br>

        Posts requests for help identifying or recovering lost works,<br>

        Archives confirmed discoveries to preserve digital history.<br>

        We’re not just hunting files. We’re reclaiming stories, documenting culture, and keeping the forgotten alive.

        So whether you’re a longtime media hunter or just stumbled in while chasing a half-remembered cartoon—you’re welcome here. Let’s dig, share, and uncover the lost corners of the media world—together.
